Color options for the protein structure.<br>
<br>
<b>Uniform:</b> Colors the entire protein structure with a
<span class='mutation-3d-loop'>single color</span>.<br>
<b>Secondary structure:</b> Colors the protein by secondary structure.
Assigns different colors for <span class='mutation-3d-alpha-helix'>alpha helices</span>,
<span class='mutation-3d-beta-sheet'>beta sheets</span>, and
<span class='mutation-3d-loop'>loops</span>.
This color option is not available for the space-filling protein scheme.<br>
<b>N-C rainbow:</b> Colors the protein with a rainbow gradient
from red (N-terminus) to blue (C-terminus).<br>
<b>Atom Type:</b> Colors the structure with respect to the atom type (CPK color scheme).
This color option is only available for the space-filling protein scheme.<br>

The selected chain is always displayed with full opacity while the rest of the structure
has some transparency to help better focusing on the selected chain.
