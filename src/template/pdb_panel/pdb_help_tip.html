<span class='pdb-chain-tip'>
	This panel displays a list of PDB chains for the corresponding uniprot ID.
	PDB chains are ranked with respect to their sequence similarity ratio,
	and aligned to the y-axis of the mutation diagram.
	Highly ranked chains have darker color than the lowly ranked ones.<br>
	<br>
	Each chain is represented by a single rectangle.
	Gaps within the chains are represented by a thin line connecting the segments of the chain.<br>
	<br>
	By default, only a first few rows are displayed.
	To see more chains, use the scroll bar next to the panel.
	To see the detailed list of all available PDB chains in a table
	click on the link below the panel.<br>
	<br>
	To select a chain, simply click on it.
	Selected chain is highlighted with a different frame color.
	You can also select a chain by clicking on a row in the table.
	Selecting a chain reloads the PDB data for the 3D structure visualizer.
